        <p>My research interests lie at the intersection of experimental economics and the economics of networks. I also have secondary interests in the applications of AI in economics. </p>
<!--
        <p>Specifically, I use theoretical and experimental approaches to study individual behavior regularities in network interactions and how individual behavioral traits influence aggregate network outcomes.   </p>
        
        <p>A related area of my work investigates the potential of generative AI—particularly large language models (LLMs)—to simulate and enhance our understanding of human behavior in economic experiments.
        
        <p> My paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05516" >GPT in game theory experiments</a> conducts experiments 
            on the finitely repeated play of the ultimatum game and the prisoner's dilemma, featuring GPT as participants. It compares GPT's choices with those of humans, explores whether
        GPT's behavior can be influenced by endowing it with different traits, 
        and analyzes the reasoning texts generated by GPT to uncover the rationale behind certain intriguing patterns observed in the games. </p>

        <p> I have also conducted research projects on network formation and games on networks, using both theoretical and experimental approaches.

    <p style="font-size: 16px;"> <span style="font-weight: bold;">  Behavioral Attenuation in Networks
    </span>  (Fulin Guo, Syngjoo Choi, Sanjeev Goyal, Frederic Moisan) [<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/148soWf3Dur-FBEwTxFUIKUDx7IecsHWU/view?usp=drive_link" >PDF</a>] 
     </p>
<p> Social interactions shape individual behavior and public policy increasingly uses
    networks to improve effectiveness. It is therefore important to empirically understand
    how individuals behave in network interactions. This paper examines individual choices
    in games on networks involving strategic substitutes and strategic complements. The
    theory suggests that an individual's choice is proportional to their (Bonacich) centrality.
    Our experiments find that while choices increase with centrality, the relationship
    is weaker than predicted. We demonstrate that individual behavior across different
    networks and economic contexts can be coherently modeled as a convex combination
    of two factors: their position-specific best response and a position-independent default
    choice exceeding the network's average. These results suggest that subjects exhibit behavioral
    attenuation—they only partially differentiate the strategic differences across
    network positions and tend to regress toward some choices that achieve high payoffs in
    the network overall, even when these are not optimal for their own positions.

        <p >  Behavioral Attenuation in Networks  (Fulin Guo, Syngjoo Choi, Sanjeev Goyal, Frederic Moisan) [<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/148soWf3Dur-FBEwTxFUIKUDx7IecsHWU/view?usp=drive_link" >PDF</a>]

    <p> Social networks shape individual behavior and public policy increasingly leverages networks to enhance effectiveness. It is therefore important to understand how individuals behave in network interactions. This paper uses lab experiments to examine behavior in games on networks involving strategic substitutes and strategic complements. Theory suggests that an individual’s choice is proportional to their (Bonacich) centrality. Our experiments, however, find that while choices increase with centrality, the relationship is weaker than predicted. The total action levels individuals choose and the total payoff they achieve are higher than the Nash outcomes in some cases while lower in others. We find that these results can be coherently explained by individuals' behavioral attenuation: they have incomplete adjustments to the strategic differences across network positions, exhibiting a bias toward generally high-payoff choices in complex networks—even when these choices are not optimal for their specific network positions.

        <p> This paper explores the use of Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) in the finitely repeated play of the ultimatum game and the prisoner’s dilemma. GPT is prompted to generate both its choices and reasoning. Results show that GPT’s behavior aligns with intuitive expectations and observed human behavior in several key aspects, such as offering non-trivial amounts, rejecting unfair offers, conditional cooperation, and reactive behavior to game history. Prompting GPT with fairness concern or selfishness significantly influences its choices. The reasoning statements generated by GPT provide insights into the counterintuitive patterns observed in the experiments: non-monotonic rejection rates over time in the ultimatum game and high cooperation tendency till the end in the prisoner's dilemma. GPT tends to be lenient in initial interactions but rejects increasingly unfair offers as the game progresses. In the prisoner's dilemma, GPT's cooperative behavior is sometimes affected by errors in reasoning. </p>

        <p >  Experimental evidence on group size effects in network formation games (with Syngjoo Choi, Sanjeev Goyal, and Frederic Moisan),

         <!--
   <p> This paper presents experimental evidence on games where individuals can unilaterally decide on their links with each other. Linking decisions give rise to directed graphs. We consider two classes of situations: one, benefits flow along the direction of the network paths (one-way flow), and two, when the benefits flow on network paths without regard to the direction of links (two-way flow). Our experiments reveal that in the one-way flow model subjects create sparse networks whose distance grows and efficiency falls as group size increases; by contrast, in the two-way flow model subjects create sparse and small world networks whose efficiency remains high in both small and large groups. We show that a bounded rational model that combines myopic best response with targeting a most connected individual provides a coherent account of our experimental data. </p>

        <p >   Experience-Weighted Attraction Learning in Network Coordination Games  [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18835" >PDF</a>]</p>
      <!--    <p>This paper studies the action dynamics of network coordination games with bounded-rational agents who conduct experience-weighted attraction (EWA) learning. The EWA model has several free parameters that capture different aspects of agents' behavioral features. I show that the set of possible long-term action patterns can be largely different when the behavioral parameters vary, ranging from a unique possibility in which all agents favor the risk-dominant option to some set of outcomes richer than the collection of Nash equilibria. Monotonicity and non-monotonicity in the relationship between the number of possible long-term action profiles and the behavioral parameters are analyzed. I also analyze the question of influential agents in terms of whose initial preferences are important to the actions of the whole network. I find that the importance of agents can be represented by the principal left eigenvector of a Jacobian matrix, which incorporates both the properties of the network structure and the distribution of individual behavioral traits.
