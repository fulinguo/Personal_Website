        <p style="font-size: 16px"> <span style="font-weight: bold;"> GPT in Game Theory Experiments  </span>
             [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05516" target="_blank">PDF</a>] </p>
        <p> This paper explores the use of Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) in strategic game
            experiments, specifically in the finitely repeated play of the ultimatum game and of the prisoner's
            dilemma. I designed prompts and architectures to enable GPT to understand the game rules and
            to generate both its choices and the reasoning behind decisions. The key findings show that GPT
            exhibits behaviors similar to those of humans in important aspects, such as making positive offers
            and rejecting unfair ones in the ultimatum game, along with conditional cooperation strategy in
            the prisoner's dilemma. The study explores how prompting GPT with traits of fairness concern or
            selfishness influences its decisions. Notably, the “fair” GPT in the ultimatum game tends to make
            higher offers and reject offers more frequently compared to the “selfish” GPT. In the prisoner's
            dilemma, the “fair” GPT has a significantly higher cooperation rate than the “selfish” GPT. The
            reasoning statements produced by GPT during gameplay uncover the underlying logic of certain
            intriguing patterns observed in the games. They also reveal that GPT's cooperative behaviors
            in the prisoner's dilemma are sometimes driven, at least in part, by errors in reasoning. Overall,
            this research shows the potential of GPT as a valuable tool in social science research, especially
            in experimental studies and social simulations.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 16px;">  <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Experience-weighted attraction learning 
            in network coordination games </span>  [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18835" target="_blank">PDF</a>]</p>
        <p> This paper studies the action dynamics of network coordination games with bounded-rational agents. 
            I apply the experience-weighted attraction (EWA) model to the analysis as the EWA model has several 
            free parameters that can capture different aspects of agents' behavioural features. 
            I show that the set of possible long-term action patterns can be largely different when the behavioural parameters vary, 
            ranging from a unique possibility in which all agents favour the risk-dominant option to some set of outcomes 
            richer than the collection of Nash equilibria. Monotonicity and non-monotonicity in the relationship 
            between the number of possible long-term action profiles and the behavioural parameters are explored. 
            I also study the question of influential agents in terms of whose initial predispositions are important 
            to the actions of the whole network. The importance of agents can be represented by a left eigenvector of 
            a Jacobian matrix provided that agents' initial attractions are close to some neutral level. 
            Numerical calculations examine the predictive power of the eigenvector for the long-run action profile 
            and how agents' influences are impacted by their behavioural features and network positions.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 16px;"> <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Experimental Evidence on the Relation Between Network Centrality and Individual Choice
             </span>  (with Syngjoo Choi, Sanjeev Goyal, and Frederic Moisan)
              [<a href="https://www.econ.cam.ac.uk/research-files/repec/cam/pdf/cwpe2401.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>]</p>
        <p> Social interactions shape individual behavior and public policy increasingly uses networks to improve effectiveness. It is therefore important to understand if the theoretical predictions on the relation between networks and individual choice are empirically valid. This paper tests a key result in the theory of games on networks: an individual’s action is proportional to their (Bonacich) centrality. Our experiment shows that individual efforts increase in centrality but at a rate of increase that is lower than the theoretical prediction. These departures from equilibrium are accompanied by significant departures in individual earnings from theoretical predictions. We propose a model of network based imitation decision rule to explain these deviations.</p>
