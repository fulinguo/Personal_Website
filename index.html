        <p>I am Fulin Guo, a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Cambridge, supervised by 
            Professor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjeev_Goyal" >Sanjeev Goyal</a>.</p>

        <p>My research interests lie broadly in microeconomics, with a primary focus on the intersection of behavioral economics and the economics of networks. I also have secondary interests in the applications of AI in economics. </p>

        <p>Specifically, I use theoretical and experimental approaches to study individual behavior regularities in network interactions and how individual behavioral traits influence aggregate network outcomes.   </p>
        
        <p>A related area of my work investigates the potential of generative AI—particularly large language models (LLMs)—to simulate and enhance our understanding of human behavior in economic experiments.

    <p style="font-size: 16px;"> <span style="font-weight: bold;">  Behavioral Attenuation in Networks
    </span>  (Fulin Guo, Syngjoo Choi, Sanjeev Goyal, Frederic Moisan) [<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/148soWf3Dur-FBEwTxFUIKUDx7IecsHWU/view?usp=drive_link" >PDF</a>]

<p> Social interactions shape individual behavior and public policy increasingly uses
    networks to improve effectiveness. It is therefore important to empirically understand
    how individuals behave in network interactions. This paper examines individual choices
    in games on networks involving strategic substitutes and strategic complements. The
    theory suggests that an individual's choice is proportional to their (Bonacich) centrality.
    Our experiments find that while choices increase with centrality, the relationship
    is weaker than predicted. We demonstrate that individual behavior across different
    networks and economic contexts can be coherently modeled as a convex combination
    of two factors: their position-specific best response and a position-independent default
    choice exceeding the network's average. These results suggest that subjects exhibit behavioral
    attenuation—they only partially differentiate the strategic differences across
    network positions and tend to regress toward some choices that achieve high payoffs in
    the network overall, even when these are not optimal for their own positions.

    <p> Social networks shape individual behavior and public policy increasingly leverages networks to enhance effectiveness. It is therefore important to understand how individuals behave in network interactions. This paper uses lab experiments to examine behavior in games on networks involving strategic substitutes and strategic complements. The theory suggests that an individual’s choice is proportional to their (Bonacich) centrality. Our experiments, however, find that while choices increase with centrality, the relationship is weaker than predicted. The total payoff individuals achieve is higher than the Nash outcome in some cases while lower in others. We find that these outcomes can be coherently explained by individuals' behavioral attenuation: they only partially adjust to the strategic differences across network positions and tend to favor choices that achieve high payoffs in the network overall, even when they are not optimal for their own positions.

             [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05516" >PDF</a>] </p>
        <p> This paper explores the use of Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) in strategic game
            experiments, specifically in the finitely repeated play of the ultimatum game and of the prisoner's
            dilemma. I designed prompts and architectures to enable GPT to understand the game rules and
            to generate both its choices and the reasoning behind decisions. The key findings show that GPT
            exhibits behaviors similar to those of humans in important aspects, such as making positive offers
            and rejecting unfair ones in the ultimatum game, along with conditional cooperation strategy in
            the prisoner's dilemma. The study explores how prompting GPT with traits of fairness concern or
            selfishness influences its decisions. Notably, the “fair” GPT in the ultimatum game tends to make
            higher offers and reject offers more frequently compared to the “selfish” GPT. In the prisoner's
            dilemma, the “fair” GPT has a significantly higher cooperation rate than the “selfish” GPT. The
            reasoning statements produced by GPT during gameplay uncover the underlying logic of certain
            intriguing patterns observed in the games. They also reveal that GPT's high cooperative tendency
            in the prisoner's dilemma are sometimes driven by errors in reasoning. Overall,
            this research shows the potential of GPT as a valuable tool in social science research, especially
            in experimental studies and social simulations.</p>

        </span>  (with Syngjoo Choi, Sanjeev Goyal, and Frederic Moisan), Reject and Resubmit at the American Economic Review
         [<a href="https://www.janeway.econ.cam.ac.uk/working-paper-pdfs/jiwp2412.pdf" >PDF</a>]</p>
   <p> This paper presents experimental evidence on games where individuals can unilaterally decide on their links with each other. Linking decisions give rise to directed graphs. We consider two classes of situations: one, benefits flow along the direction of the network paths (one-way flow), and two, when the benefits flow on network paths without regard to the direction of links (two-way flow). Our experiments reveal that in the one-way flow model subjects create sparse networks whose distance grows and efficiency falls as group size grows; by contrast, in the two-way flow model subjects create sparse and small world networks whose efficiency remains high in both small and large groups. We show that a bounded rational model that combines myopic best response with targeting a most connected individual provides a coherent account of our experimental data. </p>

            in Network Coordination Games </span>  [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18835" >PDF</a>]</p>
        <p> This paper studies the action dynamics of network coordination games with bounded-rational agents. I apply the experience-weighted attraction (EWA) model to the analysis as the EWA model has several free parameters that can capture different aspects of agents' behavioral features. I show that the set of possible long-term action patterns can be largely different when the behavioral parameters vary, ranging from a unique possibility in which all agents favor the risk-dominant option to some set of outcomes richer than the collection of Nash equilibria. Monotonicity and non-monotonicity in the relationship between the number of possible long-term action profiles and the behavioral parameters are analyzed. I also study the question of influential agents in terms of whose initial preferences are important to the actions of the whole network. The importance of agents can be represented by the left eigenvector of a Jacobian matrix which incorporates both the properties of the network structure and individual behavioral traits.
